This program was written by Francis Russell for James Kimber. It takes two
input files and searches for an overlap between the footer of the first file
and any region of the second. If an overlap is found, the merged file is
optionally written out. Only the footer of the first file need match,
data in the second file before the overlapping region will be replaced
with the contents of the first file before that region.

To detect where to look for candidate overlaps, a checksum if calculated
for the footer of the first file. A rolling checksum is computed for the
second file and when a match is found, a full check of the overlapping
region is performed.
