This program was written by Francis Russell for James Kimber. It takes
two input files and searches for an overlap between the end of the first
file and the start of the second. If an overlap is found, the merged
file is optionally written out.

To detect where to look for candidate overlaps, a checksum is
incrementally applied to both files. Since this checksum must work
backwards, it is built entirely from associate and commutative
operators. A full comparison is performed before outputting the result.
Making the checksum associate and commutative means it has some
pathological worst cases, but these have not been observed in practise.
